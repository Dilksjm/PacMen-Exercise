# PacMen-Exercise
This is a project where I was challenged to move any number of PacMen back and forth across a screen at various different speeds. My next steps will be to utilize further PacMen imaging and to be able to flip the images as they hit the boundary walls. I would also like to work on creating different colors of the images as they hit the boundary walls.
