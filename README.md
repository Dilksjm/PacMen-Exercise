# PacMen-Exercise
This is a project where I was challenged to move any number of PacMen back and forth across a screen at various different speeds. My next steps will be to utilize further PacMen imaging and to be able to flip the images as they hit the boundary walls. I would also like to work on creating different colors of the images as they hit the boundary walls.

## How To Use:
In the top left corner you will see two buttons once the webpage has loaded. Once button will increase the number of PacMen you see on the screen. The other will move the PacMen throughout the webpage at different speeds. Once the PacMen hit a boundary wall they will bounce in the opoosite direction.
